# Udacity_Generative_AI

This repository contains the projects developed as part of the Generative AI Nanodegree program by Udacity. Throughout the course, we explore key concepts, techniques, and real-world applications of Generative AI, covering:

* **Generative AI Fundamentals:** Understanding the core principles, training deep learning models with PyTorch and Hugging Face, and fine-tuning large models using **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**.
  <br>
* **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation:** Building custom chatbots with **prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and NLP techniques**.
  <br>
* **Computer Vision & Generative AI:** Creating images with **state-of-the-art generative models**.
  <br>
* **Building Generative AI Solutions:** Developing real-world AI applications using **semantic search, vector databases, and LangChain**.
  
Each project in this repository represents a hands-on application of the concepts learned, reinforcing job-ready skills in the field of Generative AI.
